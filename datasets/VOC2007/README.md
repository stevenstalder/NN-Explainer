# How to use the VOC2007 dataset

Contrary to the COCO2014 dataset, which you have to first download with our script in the respective folder, the VOC2007 dataset should be downloaded automatically when you execute the `main.py` script with the `--dataset="VOC"` option (default). Sometimes, the download servers are down, in which case you would need to get the dataset yourself and store it in this directory or try another time when the servers are up again.
